  # Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!
## This is a sub-heading...
And here's some other cool stuff:
 [title](https://www.example.com)

 Heres some code,\`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.



 \`\`\`
//this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;

  }
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or *italic*.
Or... wait for it... **both!**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](www.github.com/abdel1413), and

> blockquote

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

  
  |Wild Header  | Crazy Header      | Another Header|
  |-------------| ------------------|---------------|
  |Your content can | be here and it| can be here...|
  |And here.        | Okay.         | I think we get it.
  

  - And of course there are lists
    * Some are bulleted
       - With different indentation levels
           - That look like this.


1. And there are numbered list too.
2. Use just 1s if you want to!
3. And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
